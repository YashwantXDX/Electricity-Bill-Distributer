# Electricity-Bill-Distributer

A JavaFX Application which is capable to calculate the Complex Calculation of Electricity Bills to Distribute the amount among two joint houses having same meter. 
The Application also calculates the amount between number of houses to pay the amount of the Motor.
Main purpose of this Applicationis that when tenants live together, they face the issue of unwanted pay of the electricity amount. So I made this application so that everyone give their fair pay.
