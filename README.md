# Electricity-Bill-Distributer

A simple Java GUI application I submitted as a mini project in college. This application has small concept of green computing. Basically this application distributes the electicity between two houses ( more updates further) and motor bill to the house.
It takes inputs like Total Unit, Current Unit, Amount etc which helps it to calculate amount to be paid.
